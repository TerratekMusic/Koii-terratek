# Lesson 6: KPL Tokens

KPL stands for Koii Program Library. It supports users in creating various fungible tokens, which can be used as rewards for tasks (currently in progress) and like other tokens, they are interchangeable and divisible.

Visit [this site](https://dev-blue-spl-token-creator.vercel.app/) to create KPL Tokens.

`Wallet.json` is handled through the front-end JavaScript, so rest assured, your `wallet.json` file will never be uploaded anywhere and will always remain on your local machine.

## Create Function

Below is an explanation of the information you need to fill in:

1. **Wallet.json**
   If you have deployed your own tasks in previous lessons, you should already know how to obtain your `wallet.json`.

2. **PNG/ICO/JPEG**
   This is your icon. It is best if it is square; otherwise, it may be cropped.

3. **Token Name/Token Symbol/Token Description**
   These are the details of your token. The symbol represents the unit, such as FIRE and KOII. 
   
   !!! Please remember your token's Token Public Key, as it will be needed in the next step for minting.

## Mint Function

Next, you can mint some tokens for yourself. You only need to enter the amount, your `wallet.json` file, and your Token Public Key to mint any number of tokens.

## Tokens Owned

Afterwards, you can check the tokens you own by clicking "Connect Finnie" to link your Finnie Wallet, and then clicking "Fetch Tokens".
